Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15]. Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden', metadata={'source': 'Attention is all you need.pdf', 'chunk': 6}), Document(page_content='time, they generate a sequence of hidden statesht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.

The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains. Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [ 2,19].

In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.

To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9]. 3 Model Architecture Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35]. Here,', metadata={'source': 'Attention is all you need.pdf', 'chunk': 13}), Document(page_content='an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].

Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,...,y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and', metadata={'source': 'Attention is all you need.pdf', 'chunk': 14}), Document(page_content='architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively. 2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer model architecture. 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers.

That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer(x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .

(right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel. 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention We call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2).

We compute the matrix of outputs as: Attention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT √dk)V (1) The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention.', metadata={'source': 'Attention is all you need.pdf', 'chunk': 20}), Document(page_content='[ 2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor of1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code. While for small values of dkthe two mechanisms', metadata={'source': 'Attention is all you need.pdf', 'chunk': 21}), Document(page_content='While for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3].

Then their dot product, q·k=∑dk i=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk. 4\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.

In this work we employ h= 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use dk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality. 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three', metadata={'source': 'Attention is all you need.pdf', 'chunk': 25}), Document(page_content='Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways: •In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder.

In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder. •Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive', metadata={'source': 'Attention is all you need.pdf', 'chunk': 27}), Document(page_content='in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2. 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically.

This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. FFN(x) = max(0,xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2) While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality dff= 2048 . 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax Similarly to other sequence transduction models,', metadata={'source': 'Attention is all you need.pdf', 'chunk': 29}), Document(page_content='Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel.

Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three', metadata={'source': 'Attention is all you need.pdf', 'chunk': 35}), Document(page_content='our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata. One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required. The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and', metadata={'source': 'Attention is all you need.pdf', 'chunk': 36}), Document(page_content='is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types. As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations,', metadata={'source': 'Attention is all you need.pdf', 'chunk': 37}), Document(page_content='number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence lengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [ 31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving', metadata={'source': 'Attention is all you need.pdf', 'chunk': 38}), Document(page_content='computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin 6\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work. A single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions.

Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention', metadata={'source': 'Attention is all you need.pdf', 'chunk': 40}), Document(page_content='is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.
